# Project Showcase

Welcome to my project showcase! In this repository, you will find a collection of my projects, showcasing my skills and expertise in the field of data analytics, business intelligence, and data science. Below is a table that highlights some of the projects I have worked on, along with the tools and technologies I have used.

## Projects
| No. | Project | Tools | Steps & Keywords | Description |
| --- | ------- | ----- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| 1 | [Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction](https://github.com/khvu0610/Heart-Attack-Analysis-Prediction-Dataset) | Python | Data cleaning, data visualisation, data analysis, ML model building | The objective of this project is to develop a data-driven solution to analyze heart attack risk factors, build predictive models for heart attack occurrence, and provide actionable insights for healthcare professionals and patients. |
| 2 | [Logistic](https://github.com/khvu0610/Logistic) | Python | Data cleaning, data visualisation, data analysis | TBuilding a dataset for transportation (delivery) orders to facilitate information exploitation and find optimal delivery routes from suppliers to transit warehouses, and from transit warehouses to customers. The project aims to arrange delivery orders to reach customers within the desired timeframe, optimize inventory retrieval from warehouses, maximize the fleet's capacity, select the least costly routes for vehicles, transport the maximum amount of goods on each leg, etc. |
| 3 | [Credit Card Customer Churns](https://github.com/khvu0610/Credit-Card-Customer-Churns-1-) | Python | Data cleaning, data visualisation, data analysis, ML model building (DecisionTree, RandomForest) | The consumer credit card bank is facing an issue of a decent number of customer churn. It is necessary to analyse to discover the reason, and find out which customer is more likely to cancel their service in the future. This project utilises **Python** to perform various tasks: from data cleaning to machine learning models. |
| 6 | [E-Commerce Online Retail Analysis](https://github.com/nam-anh-21/E-Commerce-Online-Retail-Analysis) | Python | Data cleaning, data visualisation, data analysis, ML model building (unsupervised clustering - K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering), RFM, pandas-profiling | This project investigates an online retail store in the UK to discover important information about the sales so that the store can improve upon, and classify the customers into different types in order to approach them appropriately with different strategies. Customers are categorised by their respective RFM (Recency - Frequency - Monetary) values. |
